# ---------- Operators ---------

# 1.   Arithmetic Operators

result = 1 + 2  # in here 1 and 2 are oprand and + is opreator
# print(result)

print(2 + 2)
print(2 - 2)
print(2 * 2)
print(10 / 2)
print(9 % 2)  # modulus opreator always return reminder


# 2.  Logical Operators
# following operator are use for comparing
print(10 > 5)  # > greater than
print(10 >= 10)  # >= greater than or equal to
print(10 < 5)  # < less than
print(10 <= 15)  # <= less than or equal to
print(10 != 9)  # != not  equal to
print(10 == 10)  # == equal to
print((5 < 10) and (5 > 6) and "A" == "A")# and is used to combined. in and all are condition must be true
print((5 < 10) or (5 > 6) or "A" == "A")# and is used to combined. in and all are and one of them is true
print(not('Waleed' == 'Rehman'))  # not is reverse the expression

# 3.   Assignment Operator

brand = "waleed"  # = is an assigment operator use to assign value
num = 0
num += 1  # this add 1 and same as num = num + 1
num -= 1
num *= 1
num /= 1
num %= 1
num **= 1
print(num)
